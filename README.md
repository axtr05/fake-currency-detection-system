This project focuses on detecting counterfeit Indian currency notes (₹500 & ₹2000)
using image processing and computer vision techniques. It employs Python,
OpenCV, and Tkinter to analyze security features such as watermarks, patterns, and
unique identifiers. A custom dataset of real and fake notes is used for classification
through edge detection, SSIM, and machine learning. Gaussian Blur helps in noise
reduction, while a user-friendly GUI simplifies operation. The system is evaluated
using accuracy, precision, and false detection rates. Future enhancements include
support for more denominations, deep learning-based authentication, and real-time
mobile verification. This project provides an efficient, scalable, and accessible
solution to combat currency fraud, benefiting banks, businesses, and individuals.
By leveraging advanced computational techniques, it enhances security measures
and reduces the circulation of counterfeit money, ensuring safer transactions.
